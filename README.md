# Breast_cancer_classification
# Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project implements a breast cancer classification model using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression classifiers. It predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on key medical features extracted from cell nuclei. A Streamlit web app is developed to allow real-time predictions through user inputs, providing a practical diagnostic support tool.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset on Kaggle 🗂️](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)  
- Contains 569 samples and 32 columns (30 numerical features, 1 ID column, and 1 target column 'diagnosis').  
- The target variable `diagnosis` indicates tumor status: malignant (M) or benign (B).  
- No missing values or duplicate rows.

---

## Data Preprocessing

- Converted `diagnosis` to numeric labels: M → 1, B → 0.  
- Dropped `id` column as it holds no predictive value.  
- Checked for and confirmed no missing values or duplicates.  
- Detected and removed outliers using boxplots.  
- Normalized features using MinMaxScaler.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization

- Visualized feature distributions using histograms.  
- Displayed diagnosis class distribution with a pie chart (Benign: 63.7%, Malignant: 37.3%).  
- Created correlation heatmap to identify strongest feature-target relations.  
- Used bar plots to compare feature values by diagnosis.  
- Boxplots helped detect and remove outliers.

---

## Feature Selection

- Removed features with correlation below ±0.5 to reduce complexity.  
- Used Decision Tree Classifier for feature importance.  
- Selected 7 key features:  
  `concavity_worst`, `radius_mean`, `concave_points_mean`, `area_se`, `radius_worst`, `perimeter_worst`, `concave_points_worst`.  
- These features were scaled and used for modeling.

## Models & Performance

| Model              | Features Used                                    | Performance on Test Set                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | Single feature: `concave_points_worst`          | Accuracy: 91% <br> Precision: 92% <br> Recall: 84% <br> F1 Score: 88% |
| Decision Tree      | Selected 7 features with max depth = 3           | Accuracy: 94% <br> Precision: 95% <br> Recall: 88% <br> F1 Score: 92% |

## Deployment

- Saved trained Decision Tree model and scaler using joblib.  
- Integrated models into a Streamlit web app for real-time tumor classification.

💡 **Note:** The `diagnosis` target variable is categorical, encoded as 1 for malignant and 0 for benign tumors.
