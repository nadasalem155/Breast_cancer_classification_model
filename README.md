# Breast_cancer_classification_model
This project implements a breast cancer classification model using both a Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on key medical measurements.  A Streamlit web app is included, allowing users to input feature values and receive instant predictions.
